        <h3 class="int-head">Indications</h3>
        <p>Paracetamol is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints</p>
        <h3 class="int-head">Therapeutic Class</h3>

        <h3 class="int-head">Pharmacology</h3>
        <p>Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Paracetamol is a para aminophenol derivative, has analgesic and antipyretic properties with weak anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol is one of the most widely used, safest and fast acting analgesic. It is well tolerated and free from various side effects of aspirin.</p>
